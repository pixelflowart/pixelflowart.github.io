                        The project “Arrows Between Emotions” was formed with a concern to present this transformation in an artist and code developer, making the logic appear through precise and well-defined forms, but that the stage was really of emotions through freer curves involving aligned with accentuated movements in directions of straight or oblique ascents and even in more circular or decadent processes that are part of the journey of the wheel of life of art and the artist.


                        The process of the work involved the construction of a background to receive the shapes and colors. I used an algorithm that generated a distribution of noise across the screen, with its coloring related to the shapes in the search for a pleasant composition. Then came the objective forms, setting the stage, finally, for the flow of emotions through the agglutinated and dispersed curves soaked in colors in a game of shadow and light, presenting the depth and movement of the creation process and the orientation to which it takes. all the strength of this walk.

Flowers of gratitude is a tribute to the collectors of "Arrows between emotions". In the present work, I sought to preserve characteristics of the first, such as a similar color palette, but mainly the exploration of bezier and basic shapes such as the point. Flowers symbolize the feeling of gratitude, coming from different angles, sizes and shapes, just like people. Perspective can be taken from the ground to the universe in the presence of grids, planets and stars depending on their presence and position.
